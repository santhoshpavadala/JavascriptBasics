# JavascriptBasics
JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.

Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

**Commonly Asked Questions**:--
How do I get JavaScript?
Where can I download JavaScript?
Is JavaScript Free?
You don't have to get or download JavaScript.
JavaScript is already running in your browser on your computer, on your tablet, and on your smart-phone.
JavaScript is free to use for everyone.

**JavaScript Can Change HTML Content**
One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":

**JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values**
In this example JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an <img> tag:

**JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)**
Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:

**JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements**
Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style:

**JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements**
Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:

**Did You Know?**
JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

**JAVASCRIPT SECOND STAGE**
JavaScript Where To
The <script> Tag ,
In HTML,JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

****Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.****


**JavaScript Functions and Events**
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

**JavaScript in <head> or <body>**
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
**JavaScript in <head>**
In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:


**JavaScript Output**
JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Using innerHTML
To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:

**JavaScript Statements**
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.
Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

Keyword	Description
var	   > Declares a variable
let	   > Declares a block variable
const	   > Declares a block constant
if	      > Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch   >	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	   > Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function >	Declares a function
return	> Exits a function
try	   > Implements error handling to a block of statements

NOTE:JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.

**6.JavaScript Syntax**
JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:
// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;
// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

  **JavaScript Values**
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.
JavaScript Literals
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:
10.50
1001
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
"John Doe"
'John Doe'

**JavaScript Variables**
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:
let x;
x = 6;

**JavaScript Operators**
JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
